## Phase 2: Leader Election Robustness ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (October 26, 2025)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Foundation for everything else
**Actual Time**: ~12 hours (1.5 days)
**See**: [phase2-complete-summary.md](phase2-complete-summary.md) for comprehensive details

### Phase 2.1: Basic Leader Failover ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Verify leader election works reliably
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Found and fixed 2 critical bugs!
**See**: `docs/phase2-summary.md` for detailed findings

#### Achievements 🎉

**Tests Created** (4 tests, all passing):
- ✅ `TestLeaderElection_BasicFailover` (3.69s) - Leader failover in 2-3 seconds
- ✅ `TestLeaderElection_ColdStart` (3.90s) - Multiple workers elect single leader
- ✅ `TestLeaderElection_OnlyLeaderRunsCalculator` (2.87s) - Calculator isolation verified
- ✅ `TestLeaderElection_LeaderRenewal` (7.95s) - Leader maintains lease 20+ seconds

**Critical Bugs Found & Fixed**:

1. **Leader Failover Not Working** 🔴 (CRITICAL)
   - **Problem**: Followers only checked leadership status, never requested it
   - **Impact**: System completely broken after leader dies
   - **Fix**: Changed `monitorLeadership()` to call `RequestLeadership()` for followers
   - **Result**: ✅ Leader failover now works in 2-3 seconds

2. **Race Condition in Calculator Access** 🔴 (CRITICAL)
   - **Problem**: `startCalculator()` and `stopCalculator()` accessed calculator pointer without mutex
   - **Impact**: Workers hung during shutdown (5+ second timeouts)
   - **Fix**: Added mutex protection for calculator lifecycle
   - **Result**: ✅ Clean shutdown in < 2 seconds

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- ✅ Refactored calculator state from string to type-safe enum (`types.CalculatorState`)
- ✅ Created public constants: `CalcStateIdle`, `CalcStateScaling`, `CalcStateRebalancing`, `CalcStateEmergency`
- ✅ Updated Manager to use enum instead of string comparisons
- ✅ Eliminated 19+ string comparison locations in tests
- ✅ Optimized slow tests: 30s → 0.75s each (40x speedup!)

**Performance Improvements**:
- ✅ Test optimization: Assignment tests 76.5s → 18.3s (76% faster)
- ✅ Slow test fix: `PreventsConcurrentRebalance` 30.24s → 0.75s
- ✅ Slow test fix: `CooldownPreventsRebalance` 30.24s → 0.74s
- ✅ Integration tests maintained at 44-45s (optimized earlier)

**Deliverable**: ✅ Leader election works reliably with fast failover

### Phase 2.2: Assignment Preservation During Failover ⏳ NOT STARTED
### Phase 2.2: Assignment Preservation During Failover ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Verify assignments survive leader transitions
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for production reliability
**Actual Time**: 6 hours (including bug fixes)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (October 26, 2025)

#### Achievements 🎉

**Tests Created** (3 tests, all passing):
- ✅ `TestLeaderElection_AssignmentVersioning` (6.37s) - Version monotonicity verified across failovers
- ✅ `TestLeaderElection_NoOrphansOnFailover` (26.85s) - 3 rounds of rapid leader transitions, no orphans
- ✅ Implicit: `TestLeaderElection_AssignmentPreservation` - Covered by existing test

**Critical Discoveries & Fixes**:

1. **NATS KV Watcher Nil Entry Bug** 🔴 (CRITICAL)
   - **Problem**: Watcher treated nil entries (delete markers) as close signal, stopped watching
   - **Impact**: Workers never received assignments after leader failover
   - **Fix**: Modified watcher to skip nil entries and continue watching
   - **Result**: ✅ Workers now receive assignments reliably after failover

2. **Shared KV Bucket Architecture Flaw** 🟡 (ARCHITECTURAL)
   - **Problem**: Heartbeats and assignments shared same KV bucket with same TTL
   - **Impact**: Assignments expired when heartbeat TTL elapsed, breaking version discovery
   - **Fix**: Separated into dedicated buckets with configurable names:
     - Assignment bucket: `parti-assignment` (TTL=0, assignments persist)
     - Heartbeat bucket: `parti-heartbeat` (TTL=HeartbeatTTL)
     - Added `KVBucketConfig` to Config
   - **Result**: ✅ Assignments persist for version continuity, heartbeats expire normally

3. **Heartbeat Not Deleted on Shutdown** 🟡 (BUG)
   - **Problem**: Workers didn't delete heartbeat from KV on shutdown, waited for TTL
   - **Impact**: New leader saw "ghost workers" for up to 3 seconds
   - **Fix**: Added explicit `kv.Delete()` in `publisher.Stop()`
   - **Result**: ✅ Workers immediately signal shutdown to new leader

4. **Stable ID Renewal Failing** 🟡 (BUG)
   - **Problem**: Renewal used `Update(revision=0)` causing "wrong last sequence" errors
   - **Impact**: Workers lost stable IDs, claimed duplicates, duplicate assignments
   - **Fix**: Changed to `Put()` which ignores revision and resets TTL
   - **Result**: ✅ Stable IDs properly renewed without errors

5. **Concurrent KV Bucket Creation Race** 🟡 (BUG)
   - **Problem**: Multiple workers starting simultaneously caused bucket creation timeouts
   - **Impact**: TestLeaderElection_ColdStart failed with "context deadline exceeded"
   - **Fix**: Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (10ms→160ms, 5 retries)
   - **Result**: ✅ Concurrent startup works reliably

6. **Rebalance Cooldown Configuration** 🟢 (CONFIG)
   - **Problem**: Default 10s cooldown blocked concurrent worker startup in tests
   - **Impact**: Workers 3-5 timed out waiting for cooldown while StartupTimeout was only 5s
   - **Fix**: Added `RebalanceCooldown` to test configs (FastTestConfig: 1s, IntegrationTestConfig: 2s)
   - **Result**: ✅ All workers start successfully within timeout

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ All 7 Phase 2 tests passing (66.2s total)
- ✅ Assignment version monotonicity verified
- ✅ 3 rounds of rapid leader transitions (no orphans, no duplicates)
- ✅ Version discovery working correctly (leader continues from highest version)

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET
- ✅ Assignments remain stable across leader transitions
- ✅ No partition duplicates or orphans verified across 3 failover rounds
- ✅ Assignment version tracking works correctly with version continuity
- ✅ Workers receive assignments from new leader within 1-2 seconds
- ✅ Separate KV bucket architecture prevents assignment expiration

**Status**: ⏳ **NEXT** - Ready to start
**Priority**: HIGH - Important core feature
**Timeline**: 2-3 days

### Why Fourth?

## Phase 5: Calculator Performance - NATS KV Watching 🟡

**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Performance optimization
**Timeline**: 1-2 days

### Why Fifth?
**Current implementation uses polling-only** which works reliably but has slower detection time (~1.5s). Adding NATS KV watching will provide sub-100ms worker change detection while keeping polling as a reliable fallback.

### Current State
The `Calculator.monitorWorkers()` method currently uses:
- ✅ Polling: Checks heartbeat KV every `HeartbeatTTL/2` (~1.5s typical)
- ❌ Watching: Not implemented (marked as TODO in code)

### Goals
1. Implement NATS KV watcher for fast worker change detection (<100ms)
2. Keep polling as fallback for reliability
3. Handle watcher lifecycle properly (start, stop, reconnect)
4. Avoid duplicate rebalancing triggers from both watcher and polling

### Tasks

#### 5.1 Implement Hybrid Monitoring (1 day)
- [ ] Add watcher initialization in `monitorWorkers()`
- [ ] Watch heartbeat KV bucket for worker additions/removals
- [ ] Trigger `checkForChanges()` on watcher events
- [ ] Handle watcher errors and automatic reconnection
- [ ] Prevent duplicate triggers (watcher + polling both firing)
- [ ] Clean up watcher in `Stop()` method

**Implementation Details**:
```go
// In monitorWorkers():
// 1. Start NATS KV watcher on heartbeat bucket
// 2. Listen for KeyValuePut/KeyValueDelete events
// 3. On event: call checkForChanges(ctx)
// 4. Keep polling ticker as fallback
// 5. Use debouncing to avoid rapid-fire triggers
```

**Code Changes**:
- [ ] Update `Calculator.monitorWorkers()` to start watcher
- [ ] Add watcher event handling logic
- [ ] Add debouncing mechanism (e.g., 100ms window)
- [ ] Update `Calculator.Stop()` to close watcher
- [ ] Handle watcher nil entries (deletion markers)

#### 5.2 Testing (0.5 days)
- [ ] Test watcher triggers rebalancing on worker join
- [ ] Test watcher triggers rebalancing on worker leave
- [ ] Test watcher + polling don't cause duplicate triggers
- [ ] Test watcher reconnects after NATS disruption
- [ ] Test watcher cleanup on calculator stop
- [ ] Measure detection latency improvement (expect <100ms vs ~1.5s)

**Tests to Create**:
- [ ] `TestCalculator_WatcherDetection` - Verify watcher triggers faster than polling
- [ ] `TestCalculator_WatcherFallbackToPolling` - Verify polling works if watcher fails
- [ ] `TestCalculator_WatcherDebouncing` - Verify rapid changes don't cause thrashing
- [ ] `TestCalculator_WatcherCleanup` - Verify watcher stops cleanly

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Worker changes detected in <100ms (vs ~1.5s with polling only)
- [ ] No duplicate rebalancing triggers
- [ ] Polling still works as fallback if watcher fails
- [ ] Clean watcher lifecycle (no leaks or errors on stop)
- [ ] All existing integration tests still pass

#### 5.3 Performance Verification (0.5 days)
- [ ] Benchmark worker change detection latency
- [ ] Compare watcher vs polling detection times
- [ ] Verify no performance regression in rebalancing
- [ ] Document performance improvements

**Expected Results**:
- Worker join detection: ~1.5s (polling) → <100ms (watcher) = **15x faster**
- Worker leave detection: ~1.5s (polling) → <100ms (watcher) = **15x faster**
- No increase in rebalancing time or CPU usage

**Deliverable**: Fast worker change detection with reliable polling fallback

## Appendix: State Machine Implementation

### Architecture Overview

```
manager.go (Manager) - ALL WORKERS
  ├─ State: atomic.Int32 (9 states)
  ├─ transitionState(newState) - enforces valid transitions
  ├─ isValidTransition(from, to) - validation rules
  ├─ monitorLeadership() - watches for leader changes
  ├─ monitorAssignmentChanges() - watches for assignments
  └─ monitorCalculatorState() - watches calculator (LEADER ONLY)

internal/assignment/calculator.go (Calculator - LEADER ONLY)
  ├─ calcState: atomic.Int32 (Idle, Scaling, Rebalancing, Emergency)
  ├─ monitorWorkerHealth() - detects topology changes
  ├─ detectRebalanceType() - determines cold start / planned / emergency
  ├─ enterScalingState(reason, window) - starts stabilization timer
  ├─ enterRebalancingState() - triggers assignment calculation
  ├─ enterEmergencyState() - immediate rebalance
  ├─ returnToIdleState() - back to stable
  └─ GetState() - exposes calculator state to Manager
```

### State Transitions

#### Manager States (9 total)
1. **StateInit** → StateClaimingID (on Start())
2. **StateClaimingID** → StateElection (after ID claimed)
3. **StateElection** → StateWaitingAssignment (after election complete)
4. **StateWaitingAssignment** → StateStable (after initial assignment)
5. **StateStable** → StateScaling (topology change detected)
6. **StateScaling** → StateRebalancing (stabilization window expired)
7. **StateRebalancing** → StateStable (assignments published)
8. **StateStable** → StateEmergency (worker crashed)
9. **StateEmergency** → StateStable (emergency rebalance complete)
10. **Any** → StateShutdown (on Stop())

#### Calculator States (4 total)
1. **Idle** → Scaling (topology change, cold start/planned scale)
2. **Scaling** → Rebalancing (stabilization window expired)
3. **Rebalancing** → Idle (assignments published)
4. **Idle** → Emergency (worker disappeared)
5. **Emergency** → Idle (emergency rebalance complete)

### Rebalance Type Detection Logic

```go
func (c *Calculator) detectRebalanceType() (reason string, window time.Duration) {
    prevCount := len(c.lastWorkers)
    currCount := len(c.currentWorkers())

    // Emergency: Worker disappeared
    if currCount < prevCount {
        return "emergency", 0 // No window
    }

    // Cold start: Starting from 0
    if prevCount == 0 && currCount >= 1 {
        return "cold_start", 30 * time.Second
    }

    // Restart: >50% workers disappeared and rejoined
    if (prevCount - currCount) > prevCount/2 {
        return "restart", 30 * time.Second
    }

    // Planned scale: Gradual changes
    return "planned_scale", 10 * time.Second
}
```

### State Validation Rules

```go
func (m *Manager) isValidTransition(from, to State) bool {
    validTransitions := map[State][]State{
        StateInit:              {StateClaimingID, StateShutdown},
        StateClaimingID:        {StateElection, StateShutdown},
        StateElection:          {StateWaitingAssignment, StateShutdown},
        StateWaitingAssignment: {StateStable, StateShutdown},
        StateStable:            {StateScaling, StateEmergency, StateShutdown},
        StateScaling:           {StateRebalancing, StateShutdown},
        StateRebalancing:       {StateStable, StateShutdown},
        StateEmergency:         {StateStable, StateShutdown},
        StateShutdown:          {}, // Terminal state
    }

    for _, valid := range validTransitions[from] {
        if valid == to {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

## What We are NOT Doing (Yet)

These are nice-to-haves for future versions:

- ❌ Weighted round-robin strategy
- ❌ Locality-aware strategies
- ❌ Health check HTTP endpoints
- ❌ Grafana dashboards
- ❌ Migration guides from other systems
- ❌ Documentation website
- ❌ Community building
- ❌ Supporting 1000+ workers

Focus on making the core rock-solid first.

## Key Principles

1. **Test FIRST, document LATER**
2. **Verify assumptions don't just assume**
3. **Integration tests > unit tests** (for distributed systems)
4. **Be honest about what works**
5. **Focus on correctness before performance**
6. **One feature at a time**
7. **Don't move to next phase until current phase proven**
